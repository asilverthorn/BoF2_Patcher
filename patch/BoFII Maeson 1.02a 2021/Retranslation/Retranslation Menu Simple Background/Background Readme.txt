Retranslation Menu Background Patches:

I always liked the background picture in the 
ingame menu, seemed to me like a pretty neat 
attempt to show a complex picture with the 
limitations of the hardware, but I would be 
lying if I did say it doesn't make reading 
text harder than it should sometimes.

This is something I've seen other people 
comment throughout the years, and looking 
back at my hacks, now that I know a bit more, 
I thought I could do something to help.

Making the picture itself go away wasn't hard, 
but the menu screen uses some sort of blue
semi-transparent layer on top of the picture,
which looks neat, but it makes choosing a color 
for the background harder, as it creates a 
gradient-like effect and not many colors work well,
and I wasn't able to find how to edit that.

So I made 4 different patches with different colors
for you to choose. There are pictures to see which 
one you like. 

I personally would go for the Blue one, it's the most 
fitting, I just wanted to give something extra just 
in case, but again, the blue layer complicates things. 

Installation is simple, patch it to a Retranslated ROM,
even if it isn't using my hack. 

A WARNING, THOUGH! REMEMBER TO CREATE A SAVE FILE BEFORE 
APPLYING ANY PATCH TO THE RETRANSLATED ROM! 

REMEMBER THAT THE RETRANSLATION DOES A CHECK OF THE ROM 
BEFORE IT CAN LET YOU PLAY, AND IF IT'S MODIFIED, YOU 
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PLAY!

OPEN THE ROM AFTER APPLYING THE RETRANSLATION, LET THE 
CHECK GO THROUGH, AND THEN PATCH WITH MY HACK AND/OR ONE
OF THESE PATCHES, AND THEN IT WILL WORK FINE. 

I also added a small patch to revert the changes so you 
can use the original background again. 

Nothing else to say, the hack hasn't been changed.
